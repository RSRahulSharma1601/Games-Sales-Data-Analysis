This Project started with the aims to help the Store's stakeholders to understand the trends and demands for different types of games available. 
The Data-Set in the form of an excel file contains the names of the Publishers, Genres of the Games, year and sales data in million$ for Europe, Japan, North America and other regions including a global count. 
These games come in different Genres and by numerous publishers. To maximize the efficiency of inventory, profits and to decrease the number of unsold or slow selling products, gaining insights becomes necessary.
